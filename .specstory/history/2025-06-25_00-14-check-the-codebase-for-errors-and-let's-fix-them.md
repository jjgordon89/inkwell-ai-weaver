Check the codebase for errors and let's fix them.

---

_**Assistant**_

I checked the main codebase files for TypeScript and JSX errors, and no errors were found in the key components, hooks, and utility files. Your project is currently free of TypeScript and JSX errors.

If you have a specific file or error message you want to address, let me know!

Check to make sure the apps logic is set up properly.

_**Assistant**_

The app's navigation and workflow logic for project creation is partially set up, but there is a key issue:

- The Projects page (`Projects.tsx`) uses hardcoded mock data for the project list. It does not display newly created projects.
- The New Project page (`NewProjectPage.tsx`) only navigates back to `/projects` on submit, but does not actually save the new project anywhere (not in memory, context, or database).

**Summary of current logic:**
- The app opens to the Projects page as required.
- Clicking "Create New Project" navigates to `/projects/new` and shows a form.
- Submitting the form or clicking "Cancel" returns to the Projects page.
- However, new projects are not persisted or displayed after creation.

**To fully meet the requirements and have correct app logic:**
1. Implement logic to save new projects (in context, state, or database).
2. Fetch and display the list of projects dynamically on the Projects page.

Would you like me to implement the missing logic so that new projects are actually created and shown on the Projects page?

Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

To fully meet your requirements, I will:

1. Add logic to save new projects to the SQLite database (via `database.ts`).
2. Update the Projects page to fetch and display the list of projects dynamically from the database.

This will involve:
- Adding `addProject` and `getProjects` methods to the database utility.
- Updating `NewProjectPage.tsx` to save the project to the database on submit.
- Updating `Projects.tsx` to fetch and display projects from the database, not mock data.

I will proceed with these changes.
