_**Assistant**_

The errors are caused by duplicate implementations of the `saveAIProvider` method in your `SQLiteDatabase` class in `database.ts`. You should only have one implementation of this method.

I will remove the duplicate `saveAIProvider` method, keeping the most complete and up-to-date version (the one with JSDoc comments and correct logic). This will resolve both TypeScript error 2393 instances.

I will now make this change. 
````

````
The duplicate `saveAIProvider` method has been removed from `database.ts`, keeping only the correct, documented implementation. This resolves the TypeScript "Duplicate function implementation" errors.

If you have more errors or need further cleanup, let me know!
