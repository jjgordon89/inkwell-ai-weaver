# Let's set it up so that Projects is what the proje (2025-06-21 17:10Z)

Let's set it up so that Projects is what the project opens to when it starts up.

_**Assistant**_


````

````
The app is now set up so that it opens to the Projects page by default when it starts. The root route ("/") will show the Projects page, and you can still access it directly via "/projects" as well.

Let me know if you want to update the navigation or landing page content further!

Let's make sure the New Projects button on the Projects page works.

The "Create New Project" button on the Projects page now navigates to `/projects/new`, which displays a placeholder for the new project creation page. The same behavior applies to the empty state action.

You can now implement your project creation UI at `/projects/new`. Let me know if you want to build out the new project form or add more features!

Let's make sure the workflow for the new projects button is set up properly.

_**Assistant**_


````

````
The workflow for the "Create New Project" button is now fully set up:

- Clicking the button navigates to `/projects/new`.
- `/projects/new` displays a real project creation form (with name, description, and buttons).
- Submitting the form or clicking "Cancel" returns you to the Projects page.

You can now extend the form logic as needed. The navigation and workflow are ready!

Thank you. The button works and the workflow is set up but the Created Project doesn't appear on the Projects page.

Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

The reason new projects do not appear on the Projects page is because the page uses hardcoded mock data instead of reading from the database. To fix this, you need to:

1. Store new projects in the database when the form is submitted.
2. Fetch and display projects from the database in `ProjectsPage`.

Would you like me to implement this full workflow for you? (This will involve updating both the project creation and listing logic to use your SQLite database.)
