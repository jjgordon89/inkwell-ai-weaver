Let's begin implementing the following:

   - Add search, filter, and sort options for projects.
   - Allow users to archive or delete projects.
   - Display project metadata (created date, last modified, etc.).

To implement these Project List enhancements, here’s a breakdown of the required steps:

1. Update the Projects page UI to add:
   - Search input
   - Filter and sort dropdowns/controls
   - Archive and delete actions for each project
   - Display of project metadata (created date, last modified, etc.)

2. Update the project data model and context (if needed) to support archiving and metadata.

3. Implement logic for:
   - Searching, filtering, and sorting the project list
   - Archiving and deleting projects (with confirmation)
   - Displaying metadata

I’ll start by reviewing the current `Projects.tsx` page and the project context to understand the data flow and UI, then proceed to implement the enhancements.
