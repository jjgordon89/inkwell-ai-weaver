# Legacy Database Code Removed

As of June 2025, all backend database and SQL.js dependencies have been fully removed from this project. All persistence is now handled via browser localStorage (with IndexedDB for large files) through `localStorageDatabase.ts`.

## The following files are now obsolete and can be deleted:
- `src/lib/database.worker.ts`
- `src/lib/databaseAIStorage.ts`

## Migration Notes
- All data, settings, and AI provider management are now handled by the local storage system.
- If you need to restore or migrate old data, use the backup/restore utilities in `localStorageDatabase.ts`.

---
This file is safe to delete after confirming the removal of the above files and any related imports/usages.
